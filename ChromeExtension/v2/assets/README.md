# Extension Assets

This directory contains icons and other assets for the eBay CSV Processor Extension.

## Required Icon Files

The following icon files need to be created for the extension to work properly:

### Icons Required:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels - Small icon for browser UI
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels - Medium icon for browser UI  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels - Extension management page
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels - Chrome Web Store and extension details

### Icon Design Guidelines:
- **Theme**: eBay blue (#007bff) with CSV/spreadsheet elements
- **Style**: Clean, modern, recognizable at small sizes
- **Elements**: Consider combining:
  - eBay logo elements (if permitted) 
  - CSV/spreadsheet icon
  - Upload/sync arrows
  - Checkmark for processing success

### Suggested Icon Concept:
A blue square background with white icons showing:
- A spreadsheet/table grid
- An upward arrow (upload/sync)
- Optional: eBay "e" or similar element

## Temporary Solution:
For development and testing, you can use any placeholder images with the correct dimensions. The extension will function without custom icons, falling back to default Chrome extension icons.

## Creating Icons:
1. Use tools like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
2. Export in PNG format with transparency
3. Ensure crisp rendering at each size
4. Test visibility on both light and dark backgrounds

## Alternative:
You can generate simple icons using online tools like:

Just ensure the final files are named exactly as specified above.
